# ArtSync (action)

- contracts: Hardhat + FHEVM (local mock and Sepolia via relayer-sdk)
- frontend: Next.js + Tailwind. The app talks to FHEVM directly.

## Environment variables

contracts/.env

```
PRIVATE_KEY=
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=
SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=<public rpc>
```

frontend/.env.local

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=
```

Never commit any secret values to Git. The repository ignores `.env*`, build artifacts, and other generated files.

## Local development (Mock)

1) Start a local Hardhat chain (with FHEVM Hardhat node)
2) Deploy contracts
```
cd action/contracts
npm i
npm run deploy:localhost
```
3) Generate ABI/addresses to the frontend and run
```
cd ../frontend
npm i
npm run gen:abi
npm run dev
```
The frontend auto-detects chain 31337 and creates a `MockFhevmInstance` for encrypted inputs/outputs.

## Testnet (Sepolia + relayer-sdk)

1) Configure environment variables in `contracts/.env` (do not commit secrets)
2) Deploy and verify
```
cd action/contracts
npm run deploy:sepolia
npm run verify:sepolia
```
3) Generate ABI/addresses to the frontend and run
```
cd ../frontend
npm run gen:abi
npm run dev
```
The frontend loads relayer-sdk and creates a `FhevmInstance` for encrypted interaction.

## Security notes
- Do not store wallet addresses, private keys, API keys, or tokens in source code or commits.
- Keep `ArtExpoAddresses.ts` generated by tooling out of Git; it is ignored by `.gitignore`.
- Prefer server-side proxy for third-party tokens (e.g., Pinata) in production.
